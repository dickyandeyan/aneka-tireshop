		"description": "There are three common ways to repair a punctured tire: A plug-only, a patchonly repair or a combination repair. The patch-only and combination repairs require the technician to demount the tire from the rim to examine the inside of the tire for damage and repair it from the inside. Normally a patch-only repair is the safest way to do it as the damage created is minimal."
